    "## What is Cytoscape?\n",
    "[Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/) is an open source software platform for visualizing complex networks and integrating them with any type of attributes. A lot of [Apps](http://apps.cytoscape.org/) are available for various kinds of problem domains, including bioinformatics, social network analysis, and semantic web.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to cyREST\n",
    "[cyREST](http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyrest) is a Cytoscape App providing access to Cytoscape core data objects including networks, tables, and Styles via RESTful API, which is totally platform/language independent.  This means you can write your own workflows using Cytoscape in programming language of your choice.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although cyREST provides a set of language-agnostic API, it requires some _boilarplate code_ to access raw REST API.  To avoid lots of duplicate code, we've released [py2cytoscape](https://github.com/idekerlab/py2cytoscape), a Python wrapper for cyREST.  If you use cyREST with py2cytoscape, you can signisicantly reduce lines of code in your workflow.  Please visit the link below to see how _natural_ the API is for Python users.\n",
